The exact story of how Ward came up with Finn is somewhat unclear,
although it is probable that the character’s look was inspired by an earlier
Ward creation known as “Bueno the Bear.” This idiosyncratic critter—a
white bear with noodle limbs, small bumps for ears, and no visible nose
—
was dreamt up by Ward when he was a student at the California Institute
of the Arts (CalArts), and the character starred in several of Ward’s student
films and web comics.6
 While Ward has never confirmed a connection
between Bueno and Finn, it seems unlikely that the similarity between the
characters is simply a coincidence

Точная история создания Финна неизвестна, хотя возможно персонаж был срисован с первого персонажа Уорда "Хорошего медведя".
